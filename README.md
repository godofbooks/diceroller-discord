# diceroller-discord
A very simple dice rolling bot for Discord. Programmed in Python 3.7. Open source. 

This code was developed by godofbooks (https://github.com/godofbooks) as a personal project.

Feel free to use and modify the code as you'd like. Credit is appreciated.

## Please Note:
Commands begin with '$' as the default. This can be changed to any character you would like. 

It is important to also download the drb.env file available. This prevents you from having to put your bot's token (which is dangerous if it gets into the wrong hands!) in your code directly.
